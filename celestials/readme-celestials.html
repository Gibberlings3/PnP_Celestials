      <p>Something that bothered me from the first time I played Baldur's Gate II was the weakness of many of the creatures. Among these were the elemental princes, devas and planetars, and the various demons and devils. In Pen and Paper <acronym title="Advanced Dungeons and Dragons">AD&amp;D</acronym> these are powerful and scary enemies if you get on their wrong sides. In Baldur's Gate II, they were minor obstacles to be plowed over by the Bhaalspawn and his/her party.</p>
      <p>What I have done in this mod is to modify the Devas and Planetars that are summoned by the player so they gain most of their Monster Manual abilities and stats. I have taken some small liberties in how I adapted some of these abilities. Since the devas and planetars that are summoned are level 25 creatures and the monster manual lists them as much lower level creatures, I have chosen a class for each of the creatures and increased their statistics according to their class.</p>

        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches.

      <p>This mod has two components: the main P&amp;P Celestials (delineated below), and a second cosmetic component that let you use new wings animations for devas and planetars. The latter  is largely a re-used, updated and fixed version of Demivrgvs Spell Revision mod component 10 &quot;Deva and Planetar Avatars&quot;. </p>
      <p>One of the largest changes the player will notice is that Summon Deva doesn't always summon the same creature anymore. There are now three different types of Devas that can be summoned depending on which area the player is in.</p>
      <p><strong>The Astral Deva</strong></p>
      <p> <em>A General Overview</em><br />
        Whenever matters in the lower planes require the attention of the powers of good, Astral Devas are employed. These powerful warriors have both the strength and purity for just such missions They can pass into any of the lower planes at will bringing the force of their justice to the heart of evil. Astral Devas possess another ability that will allow them to perform their missions. If directly commanded by the power that they serve, an Astral Deva can pass into any layer of the lower planes without passing through the higher layers. Astral Devas also commonly travel through the Astral plane, performing any needed tasks there. They are commonly sent to rescue good aligned mortals that have become stranded or lost in the Astral plane. (Shamelessly taken from the Monster Compendium 8)</p>
      <p><em>Combat</em><br />
        Although they are servants of goodness, Astral Devas often find themselves in positions where they must deliver their messages of good by the points of their swords (or maces in the Astral Deva's case), figuratively speaking. </p>
      <p>Astral Devas have the following innate powers:</p>
      <ul>

        <li> Teleport Without Error (scripted ability)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition Astral Devas are immune to Cold, Electricity, Magic Missile, Petrification, Poison, Normal Fire, and have 50% resistance to magical Fire. They are never surprised, making them immune to backstab, and are also require +2 and above enchantment to hit them. They are immune to level loss, both undead and magical, death spells, maze, and imprisonment.</p>
      <p>Astral Devas wield a mace-like weapon that does <acronym title="3 rolls of a 6-sided die">3d6</acronym>+3 damage with a +3 magic bonus to hit. It has all the powers of a mace of disruption, and any enemy that is hit by the mace and fails their saving throw vs. spells is knocked senseless for 6 rounds.</p>

      <p><strong>The Monadic Deva</strong></p>
      <p> <em>A General Overview</em><br />
        On rare occasions, a power from the upper the planes will have need of a servant to go to one of the elemental or para-elemental planes. When this need arises, Monadic Devas are used. Monadics are able to pass into any of the elemental planes at will. They can survive in any of the elemental planes without ill effect. Neutral good Monadic Devas have been known to reside in the plane of Elysium when they are not on a quest for their power. (Shamelessly taken from the Monster Compendium 8)</p>
      <p><em>Combat</em><br />
        Although they are servants of goodness, Monadic Devas often find themselves in positions where they must deliver their messages of good by the points of their swords (or rods in the Monadic Deva's case), figuratively speaking. </p>
      <p>Monadic Devas have the following innate powers:</p>

      <p><strong>The Movanic Deva</strong></p>
      <p> <em>A General Overview</em><br />
        Movanic Devas are perhaps the most privileged of all the Devas, for they are sent to the Prime Material Plane where they often directly aid the mortal followers of the good deities. They will normally only do this in moments of dire need and usually only for the more prominent or powerful mortals. Of course, Movanic Devas are able to pass directly into the Prime Material Plane at will. (Shamelessly taken from the Monster Compendium 8)</p>
      <p><em>Combat</em><br />

They are never surprised, making them immune to backstab, and are also require +4 and above enchantment to hit them. They regenerate 6 hit points per melee round, are immune to any life level loss (level drain), charm, confusion, domination, feeblemind, imprisonment, maze, death spells. They are permanently surrounded by a Protection from Good.</p>
      <p>Planetars wield a two-handed sword that deals <acronym title="1 roll of a 10-sided die">1d10</acronym>+3 damage, plus the strength bonus (19 Strength). The weapon has +4 enchantment and all the attributes of a Vorpal Sword.</p>

      <p>Since this is my first major project using <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>, and some of the more advanced spell creation techniques by myself, I had lots of questions. Without the assistance of the following people this mod would never have been finished.</p>
      <p>With Caedwyr's blessing, TotoR did a ton of work to make version 8 possible--big thanks are due to him and his hard work!</p>

      <p><strong>Version 8 - November 30, 2022 (TotoR)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Add LABEL to both components</li>
        <li>Add a new component from Spell Revisions: deva and planetar animation. As this component fits really well and was already designed with P&amp;P celestials in mind, I have integrated it directly in this mod. I have updated it with P&amp;P skin and hair colors for various devas and planetars and fixed CTD (missing two-handed flag mostly) - thanks Demivrgvs</li>
        <li>Create Dark Planetar and Fallen Deva:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Dark Planetar</strong> is created from a planetar without priest spells (Fallen). For balance purposes those spells are replaced by mage spells. In addition to innate Holy Word, Heal and Cure Serious Wounds spells are replaced by Unholy Word, Harm and Cause Serious Wounds.</li>
            <li><strong>Fallen deva</strong> is created from the Astral deva, with less dexterity (16 was 19), but more strength (19 was 17) and constitution (16 was 15) to compensate the lake of diversity. Innate Heal and Cure Serious Wounds spells are replaced by Harm and Cause Serious Wounds.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Corrected XP of deva and planetars to match P&amp;P Source</li>
        <li>Update planetar immunities to add protection from gas spells</li>
        <li>Add always-active True Sight for Planetars and remove detect invisibility ability as it is now useless</li>
        <li>Add always-active infravision to all devas and planetars (P&amp;P) and remove the spell-like ability</li>
        <li>Removed shapeshift and polymorph self spells - why would you polymorph into a weaker creature?</li>
        <li>Removed the call Planetar spell from the Movanic Deva - it is too powerful and not P&amp;P </li>
        <li>Update levels of all devas and Planetars to more match P&amp;P (add +2 levels vs. books) and keep balanced. it used to be too overpowered in comparison with Vanilla. Now: <strong>Astral Deva</strong> is fighter lv 14 with 121 hp (15 cons), <strong>Monadic Deva</strong> is fighter lv 12 with 132 hp (18 cons), <strong>Movanic Deva</strong> is fighter/mage lv 10/10 with 96 hp (16 cons), <strong>Fallen Deva</strong> is fighter lv 14 with 130 hp (16 cons), <strong>Planetar</strong> is fighter/priest lv 16/9 with 146 hp (16 cons), <strong>Fallen Planetar</strong> is fighter/mage lv 16/9 with 146 hp (16 cons)</li>
        <li>Add compatibility with Item Revisions, specifically the Rod of Smiting (ca#monrd.itm)</li>
        <li>Add a save vs death at -2 for the vorpal effect of the planetar swords and add immunity to effect for sensible creatures (slimes, constructs, incorporeal creatures, &amp;c.)</li>
        <li>Corrected typo for planetar boots</li>
        <li>Removed the weird puff effect (noattack.spl)</li>
        <li>Set Enchantment to +3 for Mace of Disruption + 3 (P&amp;P) and update trad with +3 ; add a probability of 50% for the senseless ability (P&amp;P) to simulate that the mace need two consecutive attacks to trigger it</li>
        <li>Weapons are now visible with all animations (SOLAR animation and new animation)</li>
        <li>Restore Teleport Without Error (resource was present but not installed) - but removed it from innate. it will be used only by script</li>
        <li>Create Unholy Word for Fallen Planetar</li>
        <li>Create a special limited wish spell for planetar, and make it more combat oriented: it shows now only repeatable wishes</li>
        <li>Correction to Anti-Magic Shell, now it works correctly</li>
        <li>Recreate script to add it with the 'COMPILE' command to allow check of incompatibilities</li>
        <li>Some update to the script to consider planetar immunity to gas spell</li>
        <li>Add missing idents in state.ids and stats.ids for compatibility with oBG2</li>
        <li>Update script to remove typo, useless blocks, triggers</li>
        <li>Add missing spells for the Monadic deva </li>
        <li>Add new blocks for new spells added for fallen planetar</li>
        <li>script update: Add trigger for combat-oriented spells and out-of-fight spells and globally remove blocks that target PCs, as it is a wast of time and take too long in a fight. Those spells could always be used manually.</li>
        <li>Some bug fixes and code modernization from CamDawg:
          <ul>
            <li>Improved Invisibility 10' Radius was not providing the +4 save bonus on oBG2 games</li>
            <li>Various celestials had incomplete immunities, e.g. they would block the actual petrification effect but still report 'Petrified' in the combat feedback</li>
            <li>The description of Anti-Magic Shell had extra line breaks which would cause the in-game description to be very wonky</li>
            <li>The various 'at-will' innate spells could be lost until the next rest if the caster was interrupted</li>
            <li>Innate spells that were cloned from existing spells were not being blocked/reflected/removed like their source spells</li>
            <li>More innate spells are now cloned from their underlying spells for better compatibility: Symbols, Death, Fear, and Stun; Improved Invisibility 10' Radius; Protection from Evil 40' Radius; Protection from Good 40' Radius</li>
            <li> Detect Pits and Snares would spam 'Find Traps' every round instead of the correct 'Detect Pits and Snares'</li>
            <li>Various abilities will now use EE's engine features, e.g.  filtering to block effects (Charm Elemental) or  spell stacking (Resist Cold)</li>
            <li>If EE Fixpack is installed, spells will integrate into its better immunity and cure systems</li>
            <li>Since innate spell descriptions are available in-game on the EEs, descriptions fields will no longer contain random strings</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
